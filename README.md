## Steps to Solve Each Problem Statement

### 1. KPIs - Total Sales, Total Profit, Quantity, Number of Orders, Profit Margin
- Goal: Compute total sales, total profit, quantity, number of orders, and profit margin.

**Steps:**
1. Create a Pivot Table using the Orders Table.
2. Use `SUM` functions to calculate total sales, profit, and quantity.
3. Count unique Order IDs to get the number of orders.
4. Calculate profit margin as: `Profit Margin = (Profit / Sales) * 100`.
5. Store these metrics in the **KPI Table**.

### 2. Sales and Profit Analysis
- Goal: Analyze overall sales and profit trends

**Steps:**
1. Use the Orders Table to create a new scatter plot.

2. Set the X-axis as "Sales" and Y-axis as "Profit".

3. Apply conditional formatting to highlight profit/loss zones.

4. Add dynamic slicers for Segment, Country, and Year.

5. Ensure filters allow switching between time periods dynamically.
